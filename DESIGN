Design FAQ

Why can an entity only have one collider?

If it needs multiple colliders, one can subclass Collider to be an aggregate.

Why does the Game logic need to know about layers?

Layers potentially could be in the Graphics logic, but then switching Graphics
on an Entity would change what layer it's in.

How do you handle globals like the AssetManager and the Game?

These are regular classes, but have Register and Instance functions that
register instances as being the global instance. A helper macro G_Game is
defined to refer to the global instance. Graphics is still uncertain because
the interface is still under consideration.
