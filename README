A really simple 2D game engine in C++, created for educational purposes.
Might eventually be used to build a cool game. Inspired by many different
games and game engines.

Features:
* Window/input management using SDL
* Sound system with both buffered music and stacked sound effects using OGG, Vorbis, and OpenAL
* Graphics system using OpenGL
* Game logic management (Game, Scene, and Entity classes)
* Reference-counted asset manager (sounds, textures, fonts, shaders)
* TTF font loading and rendering with full glyph kerning data using stb
* Reads from a directory as well as from a packed data file (because Leo likes it)
* Multi-pass graphics filter support via shaders
